SSL is the industry standard method for computers to  communicate securely without risk of data interception, manipulation or  recipient impersonation. To be sure your connection is secure; when you are in  the Shopping Cart, look at the lower corner of your browser window. If you see  an unbroken key or closed lock, the SSL is active and your information is  secure.
